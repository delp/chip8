* Get rid of all the magic numbers involved in screen/canvas math
  Here's how to do it: add keys for adjusting the move and scaling vectors until things look correct.
* Add keypad inputs
* Calculate a correct framerate to run at (cycles per second, cycles per frame, frames per second)
* Profile performance, figure out which of your horrible loops is causing stuff to be so slow with vsync on?
  Or...is that even related? or needed?
* Fix compatability with flags test rom
* Add a memory monitor in a nice window
* Write an assembler/disassembler
* Update to Pixel2
